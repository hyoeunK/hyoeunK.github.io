      <h3>Baby Go<br>
        <h4>Producer and 3D Artist</h4>
      </h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">
        <strong>Overview</strong>
        This semester, the assignment for Round 2 was to create a consistent, highly interactive and engaging experience that allows naive guests to feel like they have a lot of freedom in the choices they make. Additionally we are not allowed to give instructions to the guest as they are only permitted to use indirect control.
        ‘Baby Go’ is a VR experience built on the HTC Vive to explore a baby’s room filled with fun toys. Our team set two specific goals for the project 1) Making as many interesting interactions as possible and 2) Making the interactions very natural.
        In terms of interactivity, our team chose simple but fun toys that everyone already knows how to play with such as dominoes, rockets, destructible piggy bank, flashlight, drums and trains. We made every effort to create a world that was lovely and playful to encourage the guest to explore.
        In terms of the interest curve, we focused on finding the balance between freedom and constraints as well as making the experience rewarding. In order to encourage the guest to continue to explore, our team used candy and interactive toys as visual indicators and rewards.
